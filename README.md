# PHP Loose vs. Strict Comparison

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: the misuse of the equality operators `==` (loose comparison) and `===` (strict comparison).

The `bug.php` file shows incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.php` presents the correct implementation.

This mistake can lead to subtle bugs and unexpected behavior in applications.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.php` to see the erroneous output.
3. Run `bugSolution.php` to observe the corrected behavior.
