In PHP, a common yet easily overlooked error involves incorrect usage of the `===` (identical) operator versus the `==` (equal) operator.  This often leads to unexpected behavior in conditional statements. For instance:

```php
$a = 1;
$b = '1';

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Identical";
}
```

The first `if` statement will print "Equal" because loose comparison (`==`) checks only for value equality. The second `if` statement will not print "Identical" because strict comparison (`===`) checks for both value and type equality.  Since `$a` is an integer and `$b` is a string, they are not considered identical.
